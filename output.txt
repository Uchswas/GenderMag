Answer: Maybe
Facets: Information Processing Style, Learning Style, Attitude Toward Risk
Why: Abi may recognize the GitHub link as something related to Assignment 7 because she processes information comprehensively. However, depending on how familiar she is with using GitHub, she might be unsure about what exactly she will find there or how it will help her with the submission. Additionally, her learning style leans towards process-oriented methods like tutorials or step-by-step instructions, and clicking on a GitHub link—which may not provide such structured guidance—could cause hesitation. Given her risk-averse nature, she may be cautious about clicking without fully understanding the expected outcome.
