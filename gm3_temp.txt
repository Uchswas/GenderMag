Answer: NO
Facets: Motivations, Information Processing Style, Attitude Towards Risk, Learning Style
Why: Abi sees a list of announcements and a welcome message on the homepage, so they would probably want to scroll down to read more text and get comprehensive information regarding their tasks. Since Abi is new to this online Canvas course at OSU, she wouldn’t specifically look for the syllabus page because it’s OSU-specific and typically not a primary source for deadlines and lists of activities. Abi’s motivations and comprehensive processing style would make her inclined to read through the introductory information given on the homepage first, rather than jumping to a syllabus page they are unfamiliar with. This reluctance is reinforced by her attitude toward risk and preference for process-oriented learning, making her less likely to explore options that she is not sure will help her reach her goal directly.

**Answer:** NO  
**Facets:** Motivations, Information Processing Style, Attitude Towards Risk, Learning Style  
**Why:** Abi doesn’t know what the syllabus page is yet and might not recognize its relevance to her subgoal. They would be more inclined to read the introductory paragraphs on the course homepage to gather information, as comprehensive reading aligns with their information processing style. Additionally, the homepage presents many options, and Abi’s risk-averse nature makes them hesitant to click on something unfamiliar. Instead, they would prefer a process-oriented approach, seeking to understand the purpose of the syllabus in the context of the course before acting on it. This means they would likely ignore this option initially in favor of more familiar and comprehensible pathways to achieve their goal.

**Answer:** MAYBE  
**Facets:** Motivations, Information Processing Style, Attitude Towards Risk  
**Why:** After clicking on the Syllabus, Abi might not be immediately certain that they have found what they are looking for. They see the title "Schedule" in one of the widgets, which might hint at the deadlines and activities they are seeking. However, it’s not explicitly clear that this "schedule" will include all the due dates and activities specifically for Week 1. This ambiguity can leave Abi unsure whether they have made progress toward their goal, as it requires further exploration and validation. Abi’s reliance on comprehensive information processing and risk-averse nature might lead them to question if they are indeed on the right track or if they need to look elsewhere for a direct answer about deadlines and activities.

**Answer:** YES  
**Facets:** Motivations, Information Processing Style  
**Why:** Once Abi is on the Syllabus page, it’s likely they will form the subgoal to read the syllabus as a step toward their overall goal of figuring out what to do during Week 1 and what the Week 1 deadlines are. Abi’s comprehensive information processing style would prompt them to examine the available details thoroughly. Additionally, Abi is motivated to accomplish their tasks efficiently, and reading the syllabus is a logical step for acquiring the necessary information regarding course activities and deadlines. The presence of a "schedule" widget on the page further supports the notion that this page could be relevant to their goal.

**Answer:** MAYBE  
**Facets:** Information Processing Style, Learning Style  
**Why:** Abi may or may not know what to do at this step. Given their preference for comprehensive information processing and step-by-step learning, they are likely to explore all options that might lead to the information they are seeking. The "Syllabus (PDF)" link is prominently displayed, but its purpose might not be immediately apparent to Abi, especially if there are other options such as "Course Summary" that could also seem relevant. Abi might hesitate because they prefer to follow well-defined processes and the purpose of this specific link may not be fully clear without further context. They might also be influenced by their risk-averse nature, preferring to click on links they are more certain will lead to the information they need.

**Answer:** MAYBE  
**Facets:** Information Processing Style, Attitude Towards Risk, Learning Style  
**Why:** After clicking on the "Syllabus (PDF)" link, Abi might not be immediately certain that they have made progress toward their goal. While the PDF likely contains detailed information about the course, it might be a lot to process at first glance. Abi’s comprehensive reading style would mean they have to sift through potentially lengthy and dense information to find the specific details about Week 1 activities and deadlines. This could be overwhelming, especially since Abi prefers process-oriented learning and may be looking for something more concise and directly related to their immediate needs. Additionally, if the PDF is long and not well-organized, Abi’s risk-averse nature might make them hesitant to rely on this document without further verification. They might not feel confident that they have the right or complete information, leading to some uncertainty about their progress.

**Answer:** MAYBE  
**Facets:** Information Processing Style, Learning Style, Computer Self-Efficacy  
**Why:** Abi’s comprehensive information processing style and preference for detailed information may lead them to explore the Modules if they suspect that relevant details about Week 1 activities and deadlines could be found there. However, their computer self-efficacy is low, and they might feel uncertain about where exactly to look for the information needed. Additionally, Abi’s process-oriented learning style might make them hesitant to explore different sections of the course interface without clear guidance or instructions. They might consider it, but without explicit prompts or a clear indication that the information under Modules directly relates to their current goal, they may not immediately form this sub-goal.

**Answer:** MAYBE  
**Facets:** Information Processing Style, Learning Style, Attitude Towards Risk  
**Why:** Abi might consider clicking on "Modules" if they believe that the information they need could be organized there. Their comprehensive reading style means they are likely to methodically check different sections of the course until they find the specific details about Week 1 activities and deadlines. However, due to their preference for process-oriented learning, Abi would likely want clearer guidance or confirmation that clicking on "Modules" will yield the information they seek. Additionally, their risk-averse nature may make them hesitant to click on unfamiliar sections without some assurance that it will be a productive step, as they are concerned about wasting time navigating through potentially irrelevant information. Thus, while they might contemplate the action, they might not be immediately confident that it’s the right move without further cues.

**Answer:** YES and/or MAYBE  
**Facets:** Information Processing Style, Motivations, Attitude Towards Risk  
**Why:** 
- **YES:** After clicking on "Modules," Abi is likely to see a structured list of course materials organized by week or topic, which should include information about Week 1 activities and deadlines. This aligns well with Abi’s comprehensive information processing style, as they will be able to methodically explore the content and find the specific information they need. Given Abi’s task-oriented motivation, finding a clear, organized layout will help them feel they are making progress toward their goal.

- **MAYBE:** However, the clarity and organization of the Modules page will be crucial. If the page is well-organized and explicitly shows Week 1 information upfront, Abi will know they are on the right track. If the information is buried or not clearly labeled, Abi’s attitude toward risk might lead to some uncertainty about whether they have indeed found the right information. Additionally, if the page contains a lot of information, Abi might feel overwhelmed and unsure about their progress without further verification or guidance.
