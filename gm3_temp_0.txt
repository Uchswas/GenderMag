Answer: MAYBE
Facets: 1. Motivations, 2. Information Processing Style, 4. Computer Self-Efficacy
Why: Abi's primary motivation is to accomplish their tasks, and understanding the syllabus is often a crucial step in knowing what to do during Week 1 and the deadlines. Abi's comprehensive information processing style means they would likely look for a syllabus to gather all necessary information. However, if Abi has low confidence in navigating unfamiliar interfaces, they might not immediately form this sub-goal unless the syllabus is prominently mentioned or easily accessible on the homepage.

Answer: YES
Facets: 1. Motivations, 2. Information Processing Style
Why: Abi's primary motivation is to accomplish their tasks, and reading the syllabus is a logical step to understand what needs to be done during Week 1 and the associated deadlines.

Answer: MAYBE
Facets: 2. Information Processing Style, 4. Computer Self-Efficacy, 5. Learning Style
Why: The page does have a "Syllabus (PDF)" link, which suggests that clicking it will provide a more detailed or downloadable version of the syllabus. However, there is no explicit instruction indicating that Abi needs to click this link to read the syllabus. Abi's comprehensive information processing style might lead them to click on the link to gather more information, but their low computer self-efficacy and preference for clear, step-by-step instructions might make them hesitant if the purpose of the link is not immediately clear.

Question: Will Abi have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
Subgoal Page Image: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uchswas/GenderMag/main/html-folder/images/AfterclickingSyllabusPDF.png




Answer: NO
Facets: 2. Information Processing Style, 4. Computer Self-Efficacy
Why: The page image after clicking the "Syllabus (PDF)" link does not provide any indication or instruction that Abi should read information under "Modules" to figure out what to do during Week 1 and the deadlines. Abi's comprehensive information processing style means they would need clear cues or instructions to form this sub-goal. Additionally, Abi's low computer self-efficacy might make them hesitant to explore other sections without explicit guidance. Therefore, without a clear indication on the page, Abi is unlikely to form the sub-goal of reading information under "Modules."

Answer: NO
Facets: 2. Information Processing Style, 4. Computer Self-Efficacy, 5. Learning Style
Why: The page image after clicking the "Syllabus (PDF)" link does not provide any clear instruction or indication that Abi should click on "Modules" to find information about what to do during Week 1 and the deadlines. Abi's comprehensive information processing style and low computer self-efficacy mean they would need explicit guidance to take this action. Additionally, Abi's preference for process-oriented learning suggests they would benefit from step-by-step instructions, which are not present on this page. Therefore, without clear cues or instructions, Abi is unlikely to know to click on "Modules" at this step.

Answer: YES
Facets: 1. Motivations, 2. Information Processing Style
Why: After clicking on "Modules," Abi will land on a page that clearly lists the course modules, including specific information for Week 1.

This aligns with Abi's motivation to accomplish their tasks and their comprehensive information processing style, as they will see the necessary details laid out clearly.
