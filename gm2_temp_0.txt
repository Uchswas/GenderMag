Answer: MAYBE
Facets: 2. Information Processing Style, 4. Computer Self-Efficacy
Why: After clicking on the "Syllabus (PDF)" link, Abi lands on a page with a PDF viewer. While the PDF viewer displays the syllabus content, Abi's low confidence in unfamiliar computing tasks might make them unsure if they have successfully accessed the correct document. However, if Abi recognizes the content as the syllabus, they will know they are making progress. The comprehensive information processing style will help Abi verify the content, but initial uncertainty might still be present due to their low computer self-efficacy.
