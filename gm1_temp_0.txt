Subgoal Page Image: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uchswas/GenderMag/main/html-folder/images/HomePage.png




Answer: YES
Facets: 1. Motivations, 2. Information Processing Style, 4. Computer Self-Efficacy
Why: Abi's primary motivation is to accomplish their tasks, which in this case is submitting Assignment 7. To do this, they need to find Assignment 7 first. Given Abi's comprehensive information processing style, they would naturally break down the overall goal into smaller, manageable sub-goals, such as finding the assignment first. Additionally, due to their low computer self-efficacy, Abi would prefer to follow a clear and logical sequence of steps to avoid confusion and ensure they are on the right track.

Answer: MAYBE
Facets: 2. Information Processing Style, 4. Computer Self-Efficacy, 5. Learning Style
Why: The page for Assignment 7 includes a "Github" link, but it is not explicitly clear from the image alone what the purpose of this link is or that clicking it is the next required action. Abi's comprehensive information processing style means they will likely read through the page to gather all available information. However, due to their low computer self-efficacy, Abi might hesitate if the instructions are not explicit. Abi prefers clear, step-by-step instructions, and without a clear indication that clicking the "Github" link is the next step, they might be uncertain about what to do. If there were more explicit instructions or a tutorial guiding them to click the link, Abi would be more confident in taking this action.

Answer: NO
Facets: 2. Information Processing Style, 4. Computer Self-Efficacy, 5. Learning Style
Why: After clicking the "Github" link, Abi lands on a page that appears to be a repository on GitHub. However, there is no clear indication or feedback on this page that confirms to Abi that they are making progress toward submitting Assignment 7. The page does not provide explicit instructions or context about how this repository relates to their goal of submitting the assignment. Given Abi's low computer self-efficacy and preference for clear, step-by-step instructions, they might feel uncertain and confused about what to do next. This lack of clear feedback and guidance can hinder Abi's confidence and understanding of their progress.

Subgoal: Go to Gradescope to submit assignment
Question: Will Abi have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
Subgoal Page Image: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uchswas/GenderMag/main/html-folder/images/HomePage.png




Answer: MAYBE
Facets: 2. Information Processing Style, 4. Computer Self-Efficacy
Why: The homepage image does not provide explicit instructions or a clear indication that Abi needs to go to Gradescope to submit Assignment 7. Abi's comprehensive information processing style means they will likely look for detailed instructions or cues on the page to form their sub-goals. However, due to their low computer self-efficacy, Abi might not confidently form this sub-goal unless there is a clear and direct prompt indicating that Gradescope is the platform for submission. If Abi has prior knowledge or experience with submitting assignments on Gradescope, they might form this sub-goal, but if not, the lack of explicit guidance on the homepage could leave them uncertain.
