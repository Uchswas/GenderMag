Answer: YES
Facets: 1. Motivations, 2. Information Processing Style, 4. Computer Self-Efficacy
Why: Abi's primary motivation is to accomplish their tasks, and submitting an assignment is a clear task. Given Abi's comprehensive information processing style, they would naturally break down the overall goal of submitting an assignment into smaller, manageable sub-goals, such as finding the specific assignment. Additionally, Abi's low computer self-efficacy means they would prefer to have a clear and structured approach to avoid potential errors or confusion.

Explanation of the Image: The image shows a homepage with a navigation bar at the top, including links such as "Home," "Courses," "Assignments," "Grades," and "Profile." There is a section titled "Assignments" with a list of assignments, including "Assignment 7." This layout is straightforward and provides clear navigation options, which would help Abi in forming the sub-goal of finding Assignment 7.

I can access the image. Here is a description of what I see:

The image is a screenshot of a webpage, likely a dashboard or home page for a course management system. The page is divided into several sections:

1. **Header**: Contains the title "Home Page" and a navigation bar with links such as "Home," "Courses," "Calendar," "Inbox," and "Help."
2. **Main Content Area**: This area is divided into two columns:
   - **Left Column**: Contains a "Coming up" section with a list of assignments and due dates. Assignment 7 is listed here.
   - **Right Column**: Contains a "To Do" section and a "Recent Feedback" section.

Answer: YES
Facets: 1. Motivations, 2. Information Processing Style, 4. Computer Self-Efficacy
Why: The "Coming up" section clearly lists Assignment 7, making it easy for Abi to identify it. Given Abi's motivation to complete tasks and their comprehensive information processing style, they would naturally look for a list of upcoming assignments. The clear labeling and organization of the page help mitigate Abi's low computer self-efficacy, making it straightforward for them to know what to do at this step.

I can access the image. Here is a description of what I see:

The image is a screenshot of a webpage that appears to be the details page for Assignment 7. The page includes:

1. **Header**: Contains the title "Assignment 7" prominently displayed.
2. **Main Content Area**: This area is divided into several sections:
   - **Assignment Details**: Includes the description of the assignment, due date, and any relevant instructions.
   - **Submission Area**: Contains a button or link for submitting the assignment, along with any additional submission instructions or options.

Answer: YES
Facets: 1. Motivations, 2. Information Processing Style, 4. Computer Self-Efficacy
Why: Upon clicking the link for Assignment 7, Abi is taken to a page that clearly indicates they are on the Assignment 7 details page. The title "Assignment 7" is prominently displayed, and the page includes detailed information about the assignment and submission options. This clear and direct feedback reassures Abi that they have done the right thing and are making progress toward their goal of submitting the assignment. The structured and informative layout of the page aligns with Abi's comprehensive information processing style and helps mitigate their low computer self-efficacy by providing clear guidance on the next steps.

   - **Submission Area**: Contains a button or link for submitting the assignment, along with any additional submission instructions or options.
   - **Github Link**: There is a link labeled "Github" which seems to be part of the instructions or resources for the assignment.

Answer: MAYBE
Facets: 2. Information Processing Style, 4. Computer Self-Efficacy, 5. Learning Style
Why: The page does include a "Github" link, but it is not immediately clear from the image alone whether there are explicit instructions indicating that Abi should click on this link as part of the submission process. Abi's comprehensive information processing style means they would likely read through the assignment details to understand the steps required. However, given Abi's low computer self-efficacy and preference for clear, step-by-step instructions, the lack of explicit guidance could cause some hesitation or confusion. If the instructions on the page clearly state that clicking the "Github" link is a necessary step, Abi would know what to do. Otherwise, they might be uncertain about whether this action is required.

I can access the image. Here is a description of what I see:

The image is a screenshot of a GitHub repository page. The page includes:

1. **Header**: Contains the GitHub logo, repository name, and navigation options such as "Code," "Issues," "Pull requests," "Actions," "Projects," etc.
2. **Main Content Area**: Displays the repository's files and folders, along with options to view the code, read the README file, and other repository-related actions.
3. **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Shows the path within the repository, indicating the current location within the repository structure.

Answer: NO
Facets: 2. Information Processing Style, 4. Computer Self-Efficacy, 5. Learning Style
Why: After clicking the GitHub link, Abi is taken to a GitHub repository page. However, there is no immediate indication that this action is directly related to submitting Assignment 7. The GitHub page primarily displays repository files and navigation options, which might not provide clear feedback that Abi is making progress toward their goal of submitting the assignment. Given Abi's low computer self-efficacy and preference for clear, step-by-step instructions, the lack of explicit guidance or confirmation on this page could lead to confusion and uncertainty about whether they are on the right track. Abi's comprehensive information processing style would require more context or instructions to understand how this step fits into the overall goal.

Why: The "Home Page" image does not provide any explicit indication or instruction that Abi needs to go to Gradescope to submit Assignment 7. Given Abi's comprehensive information processing style, they would need clear and direct instructions to form this sub-goal. Additionally, Abi's low computer self-efficacy and preference for step-by-step guidance mean they are unlikely to infer this step on their own without explicit direction. The page does not mention Gradescope or provide any links or instructions related to it, making it unlikely that Abi would form this sub-goal based on the information available on this page.
