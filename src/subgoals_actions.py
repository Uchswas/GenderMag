Do and Don't before answering a question: 

Here are a few facts you must consider before answering a question.

1. Read all the text on the page to check if something is mentioned explicitly, which might help ABI do the action.
2. Don't think ahead of time. Just look at the page. See if the page instructs her to take action or Is the page good enough for Abi to take action? 
3. Remember to Assume something from the action description. If an action says anything that exists on the page, that might not be present on the page. For example, if an action says to click on the "x" button under "y," it is possible that there is no button under x under y. You have to check that, too. 
4. Don't make any assumptions from the image. Process the information from the picture that you see. Refrain from interpreting anything from the image title or other staff. Be precise and consider what you see
