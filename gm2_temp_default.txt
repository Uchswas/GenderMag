Answer: NO
Facets: [Motivations, Information Processing Style, Attitude Towards Risk, Learning Style]
Why: Abi sees a list of announcements and a welcome message on the homepage. Given that they are generally comfortable with technology they are familiar with, Abi would likely prefer to read through the information provided on the homepage first. Abi would look for any clear pointers towards their main goal, which is to get started with the course. Having never seen an online Canvas course at OSU before, they wouldn’t initially be looking for the syllabus page, as that’s specific to OSU and usually not a source of deadlines and lists of activities. Due to their comprehensive information processing style and risk-averse attitude, Abi would want to gather more information before determining the next steps.

Answer: NO
Facets: [Motivations, Information Processing Style, Attitude Towards Risk, Learning Style]
Why: Abi doesn’t yet know what the syllabus page is or what it contains, especially as it’s an OSU-specific term. Instead, they would prefer to read the introductory paragraphs on the course homepage to gather more information. The homepage presents a lot of options and multiple ways to achieve the same goal, adding to the confusion. Due to their comprehensive information processing style, Abi would want to explore and read the available content before making any decisions. Their attitude towards risk and preference for process-oriented learning would lead them to favor a more cautious approach, seeking more context before clicking on links.

Answer: MAYBE
Facets: [Motivations, Information Processing Style, Attitude Towards Risk]
Why: Abi will see the title "Schedule" in one of the widgets, which might indicate a step towards understanding what’s required for the course and how it is structured. However, it's not immediately clear whether this page contains all the information Abi is looking for, such as deadlines and a list of activities for the course. Due to Abi's comprehensive information processing style and risk-averse attitude, they may still feel uncertain if this page fully satisfies their needs without further exploration, making them unsure if they are successfully progressing toward their main goal. Their task-oriented motivation will push them to seek specific information confirming their progress but might leave them in doubt until they find it.

Subgoal Page Image: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uchswas/GenderMag/main/html-folder/images/AfterclickingonSyllabus.png




Answer: YES
Facets: [Motivations, Information Processing Style]
Why: Since Abi's main goal is to get started with the course, reading the syllabus becomes a logical step to understand what the course entails, including deadlines, activities, and overall expectations. This aligns with Abi's task-oriented motivation, as they need the information to plan and proceed effectively. Additionally, their comprehensive information processing style means they prefer to read and gather all necessary information before moving forward. Therefore, Abi would form the sub-goal of reading the syllabus to ensure they have all the details needed to start the course successfully.

Answer: YES and/or MAYBE
Facets: [Information Processing Style, Learning Style]
Why: Abi is likely to understand that clicking on the PDF link will provide more detailed information about the course syllabus, especially since they are a comprehensive information processor who reads through available materials to gain a complete understanding. This action aligns with their process-oriented learning style, as accessing a syllabus PDF likely represents a structured way of obtaining course information. However, there might be some hesitation if Abi is unsure whether the PDF will contain all the specific details they are looking for. Therefore, while Abi is likely to know what to do next, some uncertainty about the outcomes might still exist.

Answer: YES and/or MAYBE
Facets: [Motivations, Information Processing Style, Learning Style]
Why: After clicking on the Syllabus PDF, Abi is likely to feel that they are making progress towards their goal because the PDF is expected to contain detailed information about the course, including schedules, activities, and expectations, which is exactly what Abi is motivated to find. This aligns with their task-oriented motivation to get started with the course. 

However, there is a possibility that Abi might not be entirely sure if they have all the needed information, as they might need to read through the entire document to verify that it contains all details they are looking for. This may cause some hesitation due to Abi's comprehensive information processing style and their preference for structured, process-oriented learning. If the document is well-organized and thorough, Abi will feel positive about their progress. If not, they might still feel a bit uncertain and could require more exploration. Therefore, while there is a high likelihood that Abi will feel they did the right thing, some doubt may still linger until they have thoroughly reviewed the syllabus PDF.









Scenario: Abi wants to get started with the course
Subgoal: Read information under Modules
Question: Will Abi have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
Subgoal Page Image: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Uchswas/GenderMag/main/html-folder/images/AfterclickingSyllabusPDF.png




Answer: YES
Facets: [Motivations, Information Processing Style]
Why: As Abi is getting started with the course, gathering detailed information about course structure, tasks, and schedules is crucial for their task-oriented motivation. Given that Abi has already looked at the syllabus and their comprehensive information processing style, it is natural for them to seek additional detailed information available under the Modules section. This step would help Abi form a complete understanding of the course structure, assignments, and other relevant details, ensuring they are well-prepared to begin the course. Therefore, Abi is likely to form this sub-goal to comprehensively gather all necessary course information.

Answer: YES
Facets: [Information Processing Style, Learning Style]
Why: Given Abi's comprehensive information processing style and preference for structured, process-oriented learning, they are likely to see the "Modules" section as a promising next step for gathering detailed information about the course. The label "Modules" suggests a breakdown of the course into manageable parts, which aligns with Abi's need to fully understand the course structure and expectations. Therefore, Abi will likely know that clicking on "Modules" will help them obtain the necessary information to get started with the course effectively.

Answer: YES and/or MAYBE
Facets: [Motivations, Information Processing Style, Learning Style]
Why: If Abi clicks on "Modules" and lands on a page that clearly organizes course content into different sections, they will likely feel that they are making progress towards their goal. This is because the structured organization of modules aligns with their need for comprehensive information and their preference for process-oriented learning. Seeing the breakdown of the course into specific modules would provide clarity and a sense of direction, thus satisfying their task-oriented motivation.

However, there may be some uncertainty if the Modules page does not immediately present the information in an easily digestible and organized manner. If there’s an overwhelming amount of information or if the content is not immediately clear, Abi might still feel somewhat unsure about their progress. Due to their comprehensive information processing style, they might need to spend additional time reading and navigating through the modules to feel fully confident that they are on the right track.

Therefore, while it is very likely that Abi will feel they did the right thing, some small doubt might persist until they have thoroughly reviewed the content within the modules.
